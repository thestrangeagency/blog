The other day we came across this nice [article](http://www.20jazzfunkgreats.co.uk/wordpress/2016/01/missed-connections/ "Missed Connections") on Twenty Jazz Funk Greats about [Telepathe](http://telepathemusic.tumblr.com/ "Telepathe"), a band that is very dear to us. We wanted to post a reminder that the Destroyer version of our ExtraSlice beat-chopping app, filled with Telepathe's samples, is still [available for free](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/extraslice-destroyer/id553340620?mt=8 "ExtraSlice Destroyer") in the iTunes app store.
